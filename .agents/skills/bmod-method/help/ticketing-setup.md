# Setting up and using bmad-ticket

Use this when a user asks how to set up or drive `bmad-ticket`. For the shared ticket-tree design, see `help/ticketing-and-epics.md`.

## Where the store lives

- Tickets live under `output_folder`, beside the documents. An epic's tickets are entries in its `tickets.toml`, and one gets a markdown file only when it is refined or published. Backlog tickets are markdown files. `output_folder` is `_bmad-output` unless changed.
- To move the store, set `output_folder` under `[core]` in `_bmad/custom/config.toml` (committed, applies to the team).
- The ticket tree of an initiative lives in the active initiative's folder, `{output_folder}/{active_initiative}`. With none active, the skill offers to create one and record it.

## Several repos

Install BMad in the workspace folder that holds the repos, put the store there, and start the AI tool from that folder so one session reaches the plan and every repo. Give a new store folder its own `git init`.

## Existing planning documents

Copy a brief, PRD, UX design, or architecture into the initiative folder as `<type>-<slug>/<type>-<slug>.md`, for example `initiative-checkout/prd-checkout/prd-checkout.md`. The UX files keep their names, `DESIGN.md` and `EXPERIENCE.md`, inside `ux-<slug>/`. Copy, do not move, so other skills still find their files. The best input is a `bmad-spec` output with its source documents. `bmad-spec` offers to hand its spec folder to this skill, which does the story breakdown; the stories cite the spec's `CAP-N` ids.

## Trackers

- First use asks where tickets are tracked and copies a starter to the store config. "Reconfigure the ticket store" changes it later.
- Choices: repo (the default; files under version control, no account), GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear, Notion, or Trello. The skill checks the needed CLI or connection at setup.
- Repo is the most tested. The trackers are lightly tested.
- With a tracker, the markdown files stay the working copy. Nothing syncs on its own: files and tracker line up only when the user runs the skill. The skill never pushes.

## What the user says

| Say | Result |
|---|---|
| "Split this initiative into epics" | Proposes epic boundaries and records the agreed order in the initiative's `tickets.toml`. |
| "Incept the first epic" | Plans the whole epic into entries in the epic's `tickets.toml`, in build order, each with an `id` that names it under the epic. No story file is written. |
| "Refine story 1.2", "review the stories" | Pulls the story's file from its entry if it has none, then reviews and improves it with the user. Full acceptance criteria are written only for a bug, a ticket with no epic, or when the user asks. |
| "File a bug: ..." | One ticket straight into `backlog/`, with no epic. |
| "What's ready?", "what's next?" | Lists what is ready to refine, ready to start, in progress, and blocked, for one epic or the whole initiative. |
| "Start story 1.2" | Checks it is ready to start. On a tracker, publishes it if it is not yet published and moves it to in progress. On the repo store there is nothing to write: run `bmad-build` on it. |
| "Mark story 1.2 done", "I'm working story 1.2" | Writes `status` in the story's plan through `tickets.py mark`, creating the plan when there is none. Done is only ever the user's, or an orchestrator's, to mark. |
| "Publish the tickets" | Sends tickets to the tracker, writing each ticket's file first. By default the whole breakdown publishes at inception; with `publication = "on_start"`, each ticket publishes when it starts. On the repo store, committing the approved `tickets.toml` is the publish. |

## Hand-off to bmad-build

- A planned story needs no file. Run `bmad-build` on it: "build story 1.2", naming the epic's id and the story's. The builder reads the entry and its epic, plus the story file when one was refined, and plans the story's acceptance criteria from the epic's Requirements and Done when, the entry's description, and its `Verify:` check.
- A story needs no refining before `bmad-build`; the build refines it. Before an unattended run, review the stories with this skill. A bug, a ticket with no epic, and an entry the user marked `refine = true` get full criteria first; "what's next?" lists these under ready to refine.
- The build writes its plan, `<type>-<slug>-plan.md`, beside `tickets.toml`. The plan carries the ticket's `status`, which the build moves as far as `built`. After reviewing the work, the user says "mark story 1.2 done".
